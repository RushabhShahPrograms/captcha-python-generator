# captcha-python-generator


Using Streamlit as frontend I have created the captcha generator using captcha library.

User have to enter name and phone number after that enter the captcha code given in image. 
If captcha is correct/matched then notification will appear that you are logged in. Otherwise refresh the captcha and submit again.

To use this repo. Download this repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after that run this command `streamlit run main.py`
